# SampleDiagrams
Snippets of a large tool for creating charts and diagrams

Tested in Windows 8.1, Eclipse Luna Service Release 2 (4.4.2), JRE 1.8.0

This tool was designed over two large scale employee questionnaires, and aimed at easily translating raw data into charts, that were later inserted into office documents by VBA.

In full scope, many more features are included (Numerous chart types; date comparison, e.g. follow-up studies; SQLite database; complex data, e.g. different scales within chart; management of data labeling; threading; etc.)

Anonymous data in folder 'res' is taken from reference project --> Employee questionnaire with > 150 variables and > 7500 data rows

Referenced libraries are in folder 'lib', and may need to be included into build path.
